# BirdBrains
BirdBrains is a turn-based interactive experience about how Twitter was used through the 2016 US election. It's built in Java/Processing and was lovingly crafted with custom image and sound assets. This project was done as a part of a major uni project in 31080 Interactive Media and was selected to be shown as part of the student major works expo at UTS.

## Features
- Two Player or single player modes
- Social engineering based gameplay
- Pulls realtime data from Twitter using the T4J API
- Uses modular, Java concepts with the Processing language

## Using this Repo
1. Use sourcetree if you arent familiar with git. it does everything for you
2. Minim should be linked if you are using netbeans. you will have to link to processing yourself. you will need to add all jars in "processing/core/library".
3. If you use a diff IDE....figure that out on your own lol
4. Do everything in a new Branch, once you have it working you can make a pull request and it will be accepted
